We all log into social media apps today?emails?work attendance sheets ?office sites?etc.
Username -Password entered and you are logged into the system .
Now how does a system know whether you have already registered?how does it allow access to you ?
Here where Databases come into existance ,all your information is collected in those databases.

Let us understand this with a example ,Pinku wants to open a facebook account
 -He opens his facebook app and the first thing he sees is the create account page -he fills up his name, birthdate,email,password
 All this information which pinku has entered goes into the database (For now we can call this as a container ),Now Pinku wants to login into facebook
 - he will now enter only his username and password -now the system will check in the datbase that if the given username and password matches ?
 if yes then pinku would be allowed to log in(imagine a person searching inside a container for a matching username and password!)
 
 Now it seems easy when i say - the system checks!How will a system check ?We add some comments that tells the database to whether add/remove/update and many more queries
